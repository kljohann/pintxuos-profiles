This is a sample (wip, not thoroughly tested) profile directory for
[pintxuos](https://github.com/kljohann/pintxuos), a simple profile manager
for Wacom's Intuos4 series of tablets. It includes icons from Inkscape
and the HighContrast icon set. The corresponding licenses apply.

Please note that github represents symlinks as text files with the destination
in them. For example `inkscape/2-node-editor:F2` is a link to `inkscape/node` as
you can guess from the contents of that file. Just do a checkout and look at
the directories in your Shell.
